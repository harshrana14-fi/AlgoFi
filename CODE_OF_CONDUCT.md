We expect contributors and maintainers to:

* Be respectful and courteous to others.
* Use inclusive language and avoid derogatory or exclusionary remarks.
* Consider diverse perspectives and experiences.
* Give and receive feedback constructively.
* Assume good faith: many issues are unintentional and come from people learning.

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

* Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind (based on age, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, religion, nationality, or any other protected class).
* Hateful or violent language, slurs, or insults.
* Sustained disruption of project collaboration (e.g., repeated off-topic trolling, doxxing, spamming).
* Publishing someone else’s private information without consent.
* Threats, stalking, or other invasions of privacy.

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces including but not limited to:

* GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, comments)
* Project discussions and chats (Discord/Slack/Matrix if used)
* Community calls, events, and presentations
* Any other public or private communication channels maintained by AlgoFi

Consequences may include:

* Private warnings and mandated corrective action.
* Temporary suspension from contributing.
* Removal of content or blocking from communication channels.
* Referral to GitHub support or platform operators for extreme cases.
